surah al-naba notes:
====================
life stages - alam-e arwah where souls are with Allah, mother's womb, life on earth, life in the grave, then aakhira 
naba - means bigger news that calls upon people and Allah is addressing the news of "after-life"
format is questioning in a sarcastic way implying their lack of understanding and ignorance (obnoxious questions about after life)
Quraan challenges everything "ja al haq wazhaqal baatil"
Quraan differentiates clearly and can be offensive to other views of God as Allah has the authority to do so
Allah speaks with authority and goes after people who go against Him
"kalla" - means 2 things: 
not at all (if said with a pause)
(if said in a flow in the case of surah naba) emphasizing, heavy like they will find out or they will know

people didn't raise a rational question they raised a sarcastic question hence deserved a sarcastic response

3 threats:
2 levels of realisation for criminals - 1 on the day of judgement and 2 when they see the hell fire
kalla sa ya'lamuna, summa kalla sa ya'lamun

Allah has created everything into paris -> sky + lamps, man + woman
Allah is a creator, builder -> His signature is "pairs"
existence of us is paired -> soul + body
our body is a machine and the operator is our soul
night being a garment is an illusionary reference to spouses being garment to each other

our life is compared to a traveller - single day -> one night experience and wake up in the morning and carry one with the journey

earth (feminine) shifts and mountain (masculine) puts it in place
earth and mountain are married! -> paired together
sky and sun are married! -> paired together
man and woman to understand the relationship is explained very well in the Quraan - like night and day
Quraan  -> man and woman -> love and responsibility

sleep would cutoff one temporarily from life
sleep + waking up -> death + resurrection (hint from Allah)
sleep is paired with death

sky -> water -> earth -> new life comes into existence
pair gives rise to new life

our life is a day and is paired with judgement day

2 things from pairs - 
1. purpose 
2. beauty

2 gardens:
1 garden on the earth (preview) and 2nd garden in Jannah

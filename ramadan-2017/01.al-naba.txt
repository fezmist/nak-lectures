surah al-naba notes:
====================
life stages - alam-e arwah where souls are with Allah, mother's womb, life on earth, life in the grave, then aakhira 
naba - means bigger news that calls upon people and Allah is addressing the news of "after-life"
format is questioning in a sarcastic way implying their lack of understanding and ignorance (obnoxious questions about after life)
Quraan challenges everything "ja al haq wazhaqal baatil"
Quraan differentiates clearly and can be offensive to other views of God as Allah has the authority to do so
Allah speaks with authority and goes after people who go against Him
"kalla" - means 2 things: 
not at all (if said with a pause)
(if said in a flow in the case of surah naba) emphasizing, heavy like they will find out or they will know

people didn't raise a rational question they raised a sarcastic question hence deserved a sarcastic response

3 threats:
2 levels of realisation for criminals - 1 on the day of judgement and 2 when they see the hell fire
kalla sa ya'lamuna, summa kalla sa ya'lamun

Allah has created everything into paris -> sky + lamps, man + woman
Allah is a creator, builder -> His signature is "pairs"
existence of us is paired -> soul + body
our body is a machine and the operator is our soul
night being a garment is an illusionary reference to spouses being garment to each other

our life is compared to a traveller - single day -> one night experience and wake up in the morning and carry one with the journey

earth (feminine) shifts and mountain (masculine) puts it in place
earth and mountain are married! -> paired together
sky and sun are married! -> paired together
man and woman to understand the relationship is explained very well in the Quraan - like night and day
Quraan  -> man and woman -> love and responsibility

sleep would cutoff one temporarily from life
sleep + waking up -> death + resurrection (hint from Allah)
sleep is paired with death

sky -> water -> earth -> new life comes into existence
pair gives rise to new life

our life is a day and is paired with judgement day

2 things from pairs - 
1. purpose 
2. beauty

2 gardens:
1 garden on the earth (preview) and 2nd garden in Jannah

Hell is like an animal waiting for the right time. One of the reason why its called "jaheem" - lion waiting for his prey
jahannum -> jaheem
mirsaad also means a road  or a place to ambush

a road everybody must travel over it - "siraat" - over jahannam
gates to heaven is not an easy road
rabbana atmim lana wagfirlana - Allah complete our light and guide us 

Jahannam is waiting for ambush 
Taaghin/tughiyaan -> doesn't respect, no consideration, no bounds like water goes everywhere
Allah put boundary around us and those people who had free rain then hell is a place where they will be confined and pushed back down
These people didn't stay within the limits set by Allah
Taaghin -> push people inside Jahannam

labsth - long time
ahqaab - means ages entire generations, jahannam is multiple life sentences

According to Ibne Abbas (ra) - huqb is 80/83 years, each year made of 360 days and each day is 1000 years from our count
Ahqaab is several huqb!
why huqb after huqb? to make it feel more painful/regretful
example: NAK at school > detention > makes him wait for 10 mins and when ready to leave then tell him you have to wait for another 10 mins
pain of knowing have to go back - hopelessness

intensity of the fire will not wear off
skin will be replaced with new everytime and then burn again
no cold drinks except boiling puss melted copper
people will keep circling back and forth when they are thirsty but will get gisleen to drink

NAK - youngsters why is Allah so extreme whereas bible so nice and loving? 
religion is not a video game or movie or product to try and throw it away
It is not a product to serve you, remember we are slaves of Allah
storm is coming whether you like it or not

Wifaaq - plural -> absolutely right, compensation of deeds, appropriate payment
"Jazaa an wifaaqa"

people who say I don't care, no sense of accountability have earned this fate

yolo - "you only live once" - lifestyle so enjoy!
these people will earn this fate

but worst is calling Allah's signs or aayat a lie
mocking them, making a joke out of them
they are the biggest liers

Quraan - book or revelation
book of deeds - angels write down what we say, every action, every gesture, every lie, word of opression, bulge on your forehead
"summa nazara wa abasa wa basar"

believers have the ultimate success
mafaaz - captures both place and time of success
smooth transition from judgement day to jannah
those who protect themselves in addtion to believe
body is an animal it wants to fulfill its lust, greed, etc. 
if we stop protecting them soul gets weaker like we stop going to the gym then muscles get weaker
Quraan's language -  you're dead or not alive

Allah made this world beautiful as a preview of Jannah
hebrew bible has no mention of hell!
Allah speaks about reality so He speaks of hell in the Quraan
Allah takes humour out of the subject when He speaks about hell

atraab - custom wife for the man, exactly as you like
shaitaan's ultimate plot - faaisha - become shameless

spalshing drinks in jannah is a description of being merry
not hear any useless talks, feel better, no lies or evil things said about islam, quraan, believers
laghu - useless
jazaa from Allah - only mentioned for jannah and not hell meaning hell is your earning and jannah is the gift from Allah
rabb + rahman > grant comes from ar-rahman, rabb - is what we serve to Allah

when the book of deeds is laid out people will question why it records every little deed! so they will be allowed to speaks
but on judgement day no one will be allowed to speak (la yata kallamun) except for (implied) Prophet (pbuh) will be granted the status of intercession (makamum mahmuda)
hadith of shafa'a (intercession)
will say no more no less i.e. very precise (example: judge show - get to the point no tell tale stories)
that day angels and ruh (jibrael a.s) will be standing in a line
accused will be taken away for sentencing
others escorted or welcomed into heaven
that day is the day of haq (truth or right or purpose)

liers and the disbelievers will wish they could turn into dust

perfect symmetry:
start: question on judgment day
middle: judgement day
end: judgement day

pairs - sky and sun, sky and earth, earth and mountains, necessities and beauty, man and woman, sleep and waking up, death and afterlife
after judgement day pairs separated - jannah and jahannam

surah al-naba notes:
====================
life stages - alam-e arwah where souls are with Allah, mother's womb, life on earth, life in the grave, then aakhira 
naba - means bigger news that calls upon people and Allah is addressing the news of "after-life"
format is questioning in a sarcastic way implying their lack of understanding and ignorance (obnoxious questions about after life)
Quraan challenges everything "ja al haq wazhaqal baatil"
Quraan differentiates clearly and can be offensive to other views of God as Allah has the authority to do so
Allah speaks with authority and goes after people who go against Him
"kalla" - means 2 things: 
not at all (if said with a pause)
(if said in a flow in the case of surah naba) emphasizing, heavy like they will find out or they will know

people didn't raise a rational question they raised a sarcastic question hence deserved a sarcastic response

3 threats:
2 levels of realisation for criminals - 1 on the day of judgement and 2 when they see the hell fire
kalla sa ya'lamun, summa kalla sa ya'lamun

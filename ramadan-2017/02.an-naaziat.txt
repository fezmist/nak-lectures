surah an-naaziat:
=================
Allah swears by a number of objects or things 
swear by those that drown
those set loose
those that swim rapidly
those that march ahead
those that execute the plan or command of Allah

how cum Prophet (pbuh) did not comment on every aayah?
there is a wisdom in the fact he didn't speak
meaning is so deep of aayat like an ocean that people will not appreciate its depth if there was commentary or opinion on it 
exercise Allah wants human being to be engaged in, ponder over
everyone has different levels of knowledge and experience
india - pakistan opinion -> don't draw your conclusions as you might be wrong and misguided so follow a spirtual leader or aalim
don't think somebody who has studied tafsir in detail has answers then you're wrong
Quraan's aayat are oceans of knowledge
knowledge of any field has been enhanced 
creation is also called aayat and revelation is also called aayat
its not about the feeling its about the attitude that should be correct to understand these aayat

nazaat -> pull until max tension (figuratively drowning i.e. maxed out)
women drowned everybody's eyes when she walked into the room i.e. drowning 
picture a village > horses at the top of the hill holding the reigns or tension as much as possible > waiting to march or set loose > 
nashaat -> knot that can't be undone easily and then it go entirely
saabihat > means swim > sabhan > means really swim fast
1. violent extreme -> horses running in the desert pierce through the sand and leave a trail
2. smooth -> floating or swimming in the air
saabiq -> someone who gets there first
saabiqaati sabqan > means get there fast really fast
dabbara > means to plan, also means to execute the plan
tadbir > planning but doesn't mean executed plan
mudabbirati amra > well organised and executed plan

theories to understand when Allah takes an oath, what is the purpose of Allah swearing?
al-qasm wal jawabal qasm > includes fill in the blank but not always in the Quraan when Allah swears by something
if there is no response then it is understood becuase of what is coming after it
Allah's speech is free of cages, rules or grammar, etc. keeps defying the norm or boundaries
Allah's speech is far more supreme over the rules of a language

2 ways of looking at it:
1. when it is a big deal like swearing by the fig or olive so it must be awesome
2. natural effect is to get someone's attention, build the excitement

arrajifah > something that shakes and shakes everything else

Allah is holding back the reigns of the earth from shaking but that day He will let it go
Allah is trying to explain the day of judgement will come so swiftly that no one will have time to think

raajif > shaking like fever so the earth will be shaking and let go
earth is holding a lot of secrets and evil of mankind 
sometimes duo to their sins they get a preview of the shaking, a taste of earth being hurt by your actions

when the shaking is happening no one has time to even think who is shaking it as too much of a state of emergency

raadifa > wave after a wave, second wave

qulubun waajifa > hearts are disturbed or scared as you're going to be taken for a trial 
you already know what you did i.e. being a disappointment, humiliation
absaaruha > eyes of the heart > tell from the eyes your feeling of the heart > eyes connected to the heart
nakhir > hollow, breaks easily 

hafara > throw dirt up, horse digs the dirt on the ground in one place and not moving, ditch of a grave
zajar > scolding of an animal
muzdajar > deserves to be yelled at

zajaratun wahida > single scolding is enough then do defiance will be left
saahira > a night in which they can't sleep, sleepless night
judgement day is dark since night is mentioned

on judgement day criminals will be raided

valley of tua > sacred valley > long debates with firaun but here its super brief?
the main point Allah is trying to make is if Allah dealt with firaun then who are you quraish

tua > sacred place, rolled up portion if the night, (most beautiful) adverb - haal - skies and the earth folded up on that night
tagah > cross the line

money + power > can infect anyone or any society or any country > politcal corruption > spirtual corruption
Quraan cleanse us from this infection

Allah is the judge He knows what's in everyone's hear so He is the only one to judge
hal laka ila un tazaka > polite way of saying possibility of heading in the direction of becoming a better person
tazaka > purifying, becoming a better human being

judgement day no mercy but before invite them softly
our job is to deliver with love and leave the judgement for Allah even though Allah knows they will not listen

aayatul kubra > 
1. first call is to goodness, kindness, forgiveness, mercy, justice, standing up against opression. Should appeal to any decent human being
2. aayatul kubra > only be from Allah > the signs
Musa (a.s) > called firaun to goodness first and then when things got worse then showed the aayat or signs

we can't run from society even though we are a minority
we have to face the fitna as we are the only hope i.e. Islam
Madinah and Mecca had a lot of fitna but Prophet (pbuh) and the sahabah (r.a) stood up to it and turned it around
we are going to be in uncomfortable environment and that's how we fulfil our role as a muslim
